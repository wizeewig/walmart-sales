# Walmart Data Analysis: End-to-End SQL + Python Project

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. I utilized Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.

* Business Problem-Solved: Written and executed complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
Revenue trends across branches and categories.
Identifying best-selling product categories.
Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
